# Developers Community Pokhara

## Goals
1. Build a community of developers working and/or based in the city of Pokhara, Nepal.
2. We want to keep our group language agnostic so that more people can come together and participate regardless of their language specialization.
3. We want to organize meets and other events.
4. We want to make this a platform where Pokhara based developers can come together, know each other and share ideas
